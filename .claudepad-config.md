# ClaudePad Configuration

This project serves as a design workspace and discussion hub for feature planning and project specification development.

## Project Structure

```
claudepad/
├── conversations/
│   ├── raw/           # Complete conversation transcripts
│   └── summaries/     # Distilled conversation summaries
├── artifacts/         # Output specs, PRDs, and documentation
└── templates/         # Reusable templates for specs and documents
```

## Session Workflow

### During Session
- Engage in design discussions
- Explore ideas and requirements
- Ask clarifying questions
- Document decisions as they emerge

### End of Session
1. **Save Raw Conversation**: Store complete transcript in `conversations/raw/`
2. **Generate Summary**: Create distilled summary in `conversations/summaries/`
3. **Create Artifacts**: Produce actionable specs/PRDs in `artifacts/`

## File Naming Convention

### Raw Conversations
Format: `YYYY-MM-DD_topic-slug.md`
Example: `2025-10-21_user-authentication-redesign.md`

### Summaries
Format: `YYYY-MM-DD_topic-slug_summary.md`
Example: `2025-10-21_user-authentication-redesign_summary.md`

### Artifacts
Format: `[type]_topic-slug.md`
Types: `spec`, `prd`, `design`, `architecture`
Example: `spec_user-authentication-redesign.md`

## Artifact Types

### Project Specification (spec_)
Complete technical specification for implementation
- Requirements
- Technical approach
- Architecture decisions
- Implementation details
- Acceptance criteria

### Product Requirements Document (prd_)
Product-focused requirements
- User stories
- Business requirements
- Success metrics
- Stakeholder needs

### Design Document (design_)
UI/UX and design system specifications
- User flows
- Wireframes/mockups
- Design patterns
- Component specifications

### Architecture Document (architecture_)
System architecture and technical design
- System diagrams
- Technology stack
- Integration points
- Data models
- Security considerations

## Usage Notes

- Conversations can be freeform and exploratory
- No need to commit conversation files unless they contain valuable long-term reference
- Artifacts should be implementation-ready and can be used with other AI dev tools
- Use Serena MCP to maintain session context across interruptions
